This project was completed using data and prompts provided by the Oklahoma City Thunder for the purposes of a technical assessment.
The two main components are a visualization of schedule difficulty (excluding strength of opponent), and a model of schedule difficulty (including strength of opponent).
The visualization was made with plotly, with the less concise code coming as a result of my desire to include functionality not present within ggplot.

Included here is the .Rmd file containing the project and an HTML file with the project in more readable format.
